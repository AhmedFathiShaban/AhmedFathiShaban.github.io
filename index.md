# Seattle : Do Business & Have Fun !

Seattle is one of the tourist attractions in Washigton. In Seattle, you could visit the [Space Needle](https://www.spaceneedle.com/), the [Art Museum](https://www.seattleartmuseum.org/), the [Aquarium](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/), and many more !

* Tourists (looking to visit and have fun!)

Anyway, following my assumption, I found that roughly 87.37% of property owners in Seattle actually do live in Seattle themselves. This shows that the company should still put most of its campaigning effort in Seattle itself!
The remaining 22.73% were distributes accourding to the following pie chart :
